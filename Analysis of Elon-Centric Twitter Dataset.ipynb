    "## Assignment Description\n",
    "For this project I am going to be using our class Mongo database of Elon Musk's tweets to see if there are any patterns to his tweets, by specifically looking at his tweets in relation to SpaceX and Tesla. In addition, I am also analyzing the tweets from the SpaceX and Tesla twitter accounts. I will be looking for any pattern relating to an increase or decrease of activity on twitter during the time of special conferences or news events. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "To answer these questions, I will be completeing the following: \n",
    " 1. Creating various methods to pull the text of tweets within a set timerange from a given date and looking at the texts themselves\n",
    " 2. Create a method to randomly pull ranges of tweets, this would serve as a control (this will be compared to the ranges of dates of major events of SpaceX and Tesla)\n",
    " 4. Use a variety of data analysis tools to see if there is a pattern in Elon Musks tweets, in relation to SpaceX and Telsa"
